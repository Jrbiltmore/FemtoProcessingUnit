# Installation Guide for FemtoProcessing Unit (FPU)

Welcome to the installation guide for the FemtoProcessing Unit (FPU). This document will walk you through the process of setting up the FPU for use in your computing environment, ensuring you can leverage its advanced quantum-classical computing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Operating System**: Ensure you are running a compatible operating system such as Linux, Windows 10, or macOS.
- **Hardware Requirements**: A minimum of 8GB RAM and a quad-core processor. For optimal performance, 16GB RAM and an octa-core processor or better are recommended.
- **Software Dependencies**: Python 3.8 or newer, Docker, and Git.
- **Cloud Access**: For cloud functionalities, ensure you have active accounts with your preferred cloud service providers (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).

## Step 1: Environment Setup

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
   - It's recommended to create a virtual environment for the FPU software to manage dependencies effectively.
   ```
   python -m venv fpu-env
   source fpu-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `fpu-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Docker**:
   - Install Docker on your system following the instructions on the official Docker website.
   - Make sure Docker is running before proceeding with the installation.

3. **Git**:
   - If not already installed, download and install Git from its official website.

## Step 2: Download the FPU Software

Clone the FPU repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/jrbiltmore/fpu.git
cd fpu
```

## Step 3: Install Required Libraries

Within your activated Python virtual environment, install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Docker Containers Setup

Some components of the FPU might require running specific services in Docker containers. Use the provided Docker Compose file to set up these services:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Step 5: Cloud Service Configuration

Configure the FPU to integrate with cloud services by setting up the necessary credentials. This process varies depending on the cloud provider. Refer to the `Cloud_Services_Integration.md` for detailed instructions.

## Step 6: Verify Installation

To verify that the FPU is installed correctly and is operational, run the included test suite:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

If all tests pass, your FPU installation is successful and ready for use.

## Step 7: Start the FPU Interface

Finally, start the FPU interface to begin using the unit. This can vary based on the deployment, but typically involves running a Python script or a web server:

```
python run_fpu.py  # Example command
```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the FemtoProcessing Unit (FPU). Explore the provided documentation and examples to start leveraging the power of quantum-classical computing in your projects.
